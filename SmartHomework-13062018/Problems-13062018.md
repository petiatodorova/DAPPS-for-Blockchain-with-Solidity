# Homework: Intro to Ethereum and Smart Contracts

### Problem 1. Bad Coding Task or Why Loops are “Forbidden”
Write a smart contract to calculate the factorial of a given number. Create two different solutions (iterative and recursive)
Do you observe any obvious problems?
How to prevent it?
Compare both solutions

### Problem 2. Random number generation
Write a smart contract which provides a function that generates a random number. For that purpose you must use all appropriate (in your opinion) properties from 42 and 43 slides.
